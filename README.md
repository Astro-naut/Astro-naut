### HELLOO WORLD!!!!!

ðŸ”­Iâ€™m currently working on so many things, Iâ€™ve lost count. After all, being an engineering major comes with a never-ending to-do list. Letâ€™s list some of them, shall we?
- First off, my DevSecOps internship@Validus Capital, where Iâ€™ve been working on cloud security, learning new tools, and genuinely enjoying the experience.
- Secondly, I am also an avid learner of Full Stack Development and love the idea of expressing myself in this sort of public digital scrapbook - we all know as the internet (ik im still stuck in 2008).
- Here comes the part where I say, 'I love solving problems,' but honestly, I really doâ€”itâ€™s been a passion of mine since childhood. Iâ€™m just getting started on my Data Structures and Algorithms journey, but Iâ€™m excited to dive in and Iâ€™ll keep you posted!
- I also hold numerous leadership roles such as President of the NSS, along with being the Class President, three years running, and a member of my college tech society.
- In the meantime, I love penning down my thoughts and sharing them with y'all. Hereâ€™s the link to my article: [How Lost Are You?](https://medium.com/@amriii/how-lost-are-you-68f8d3cf9d31)    Give it a read and let me know your thoughts in the comments! 

- Phew! Now thats alot of information about me - I wanna hear some about you...
