### HELLOO WORLD!!!!!

🔭I’m currently working on so many things, I’ve lost count. After all, being an engineering major comes with a never-ending to-do list. Let’s list some of them, shall we?
- First off, my DevSecOps internship@Validus Capital, where I’ve been working on cloud security, learning new tools, and genuinely enjoying the experience.
- Secondly, I am also an avid learner of Full Stack Development and love creating website and designing websites for my clients.
- I hold numerous leadership roles such as President of the NSS, along with being the Class President, three years running, and a member of my college tech society.
- In the meantime, I love penning down my thoughts and sharing them with you all. Here’s the link to my article: [How Lost Are You?](https://medium.com/@amriii/how-lost-are-you-68f8d3cf9d31) Give it a read and let me know your thoughts in the comments!
