### HELLOO WORLD!!!!!

ðŸ”­Iâ€™m currently working on so many things, Iâ€™ve lost count. After all, being an engineering major comes with a never-ending to-do list. Letâ€™s list some of them, shall we?
- First off, my DevSecOps internship@Validus Capital.
- Secondly, I am also an avid learner of Full Stack Development and love creating website and designing websites for my clients.
- I hold numerous leadership roles such as the Class President, three years running, along with the President of NSS and a member of my college tech society.
- In the meantime, I love penning down my thoughts and sharing them with you all. Hereâ€™s the link to my article: [How Lost Are You?](https://medium.com/@amriii/how-lost-are-you-68f8d3cf9d31) Give it a read and let me know your thoughts in the comments!
